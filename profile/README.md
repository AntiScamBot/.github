**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ The AntiScam blocks websites in your discord server that are on our blacklist.\
😉 You can also contribute to this project @ [AntiScamBot/Anti-Scam-Link-List](https://github.com/AntiScamBot/Anti-Scam-Link-List).\
🍿 Fun fact: Discord is Discord, Wumpus is Wumpus, Wungus is Wungus and AntiScam is AntiScam.\
🧙 SHAZAM!
